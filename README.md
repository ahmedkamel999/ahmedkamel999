Hi, I'm Ahmed, I'm passionate about software development and 
I'm skilled in HTML, CSS and Python (Django). I am now looking for a web developer position because I recently learned how to code by myself

I describe my self as someone who's persistant, a quick learner and loves problems solving by using simple and scalable solutions.
